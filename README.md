# intent1
This specification is divide into two parts.
For the controllerOnly implementation, I created the intent and qos steps in the controller. In the next file I added 
the gold level subscriber as the user that can maintain high qos and band width based on the specification defined in the 
Controller. I created two files to show the composability and scalability features of my sepcification that I will explain
in more detail in the overleaf file.
